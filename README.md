# Lendo Shopping Cart

This is the TypeScript version of the Lendo Shopping Cart exercise. [View demo](https://lendo-ts.web.app)

For the full explanation, see the original [project](https://github.com/elalienx/lendo-shopping-cart). This repository covers only the new additions.

⚠️ **Note:** The Product page is **intentionally** missing as it will be rebuilt to improve the add-to-cart feature and refactor the code.

## Planed improvements

1. Migrated to TypeScript. ✅
1. Add an enhanced add to cart feature.
1. Create a new, enhanced Product page to avoid `useEffect()`
1. Match the original Sketch design. (see original project for more info)

## Bonus features

1. Use Redux instead of ContextAPI to see if it reduces unncecerary re-renders.
1. Create custom toast notification to reduce dependencies.
1. Add Biome linter.
