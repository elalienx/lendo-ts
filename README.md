Link to demo: [Demo website](https://lendo-shopping-cart.web.app)

## Installation

To run locally clone this repository into your computer and then:

1. Install dependencies using `npm clean-install` to ensure using the same versions as the project.
1. Run using `npm run dev`
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Features

1. A CI/CD pipeline that runs the Vitest logic tests, React Testing Library UI tests, and deploys to Firebase Hosting.
1. A gallery to view components similar to Storybook but with a lighter library and easier configuration called [React Cosmos](https://reactcosmos.org).
1. Reducers to mutate the state outside React and make it easily testable.
1. Responsive design.
1. User flows to plan the UX ([link](https://whimsical.com/lendo-Devit5GaSiDyojUePbMpEz@6HYTAunKLgTVswxCCSQ4eXBALzucnJcoopxkWQAUe9NGL4J))
1. Optimized bundle size, asset loading, and cache policies to reach a score of 100/100 in [Google Page Speed Insights](./public/readme-page-speed.png).

## View React Components

If you'd like to view the React components individually, you can use the component gallery built with Cosmos:

1. Start the component gallery with `npm run cosmos`
1. Open your browser and go to `localhost:5001` (or the port specified in the terminal).

## Requirements

Create the following views/pages using the mock JSON:

1. üè† Product view
   - A list with the name and pricing of each product. ‚úÖ
   - The user should view the number of items in the cart. ‚úÖ
2. üë† Detail view
   - A details view where a user can view product details and add the product to the cart. ‚úÖ
   - Make sure a product cannot be added if it is unavailable. ‚úÖ
   - If a product has variants (colors, sizes, etc) the user should be able to select the variant they want before adding it to their cart. ‚úÖ
   - Show visual feedback when adding a product. ‚úÖ (Toast notification)
3. üõí Checkout view
   - A checkout view where a user can see their cart before proceeding with payments. ‚úÖ (payments page its out of scope)
   - The user should be able to increment and decrement the product quantity as well. ‚úÖ
   - As remove the product completely. ‚úÖ

## Product Option Analysis

![Mind map diagram](./public/readme-product-options-analysis.png)

The tricky part is realizing that **color** serves as the index for product-option. Selecting the first color maps to `array[0]`, the second to `array[1]`, and so on. After that, it‚Äôs just a simple filter operation.

## Bugs Alert üêû

1. ~There is a bug noticeable on the Nintendo Switch (probably on other products) where the radio key of the product variant is not being updated. Will take a look after work.~ ‚úÖ (fixed on 2024-9-16 at 13:41)
1. ~Input radio's must be accessibile~ ‚úÖ (fixed on 2024-9-18 at 18:18)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If you find any other bug, please open a pull request.

## Future Improvements

The project could be enhanced with the following features:

1. Detect and update quantity for the same product, color, and variant instead of adding a new item to the cart.
1. Incorporate TypeScript for better type safety.
1. Refactor for improved maintainability (an extra day would help).
1. Develop a custom notification system to avoid external libraries.
1. Add Biome linter.
1. Implement Suspense to optimize build size.
1. Enhance the Product page design ([reference](./public/readme-product-page.png)).
